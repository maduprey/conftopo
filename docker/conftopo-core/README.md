# conftopo-core
A Docker image for the core components of ConfTopo.

* Ubuntu 20.04 with ChimeraX as base image
* Install `pip3` and `git`
* Install essential Python libraries for ConfTopo:
	* `numpy `
	* `pandas`
	* `matplotlib`
	* `streamlit`
	* `biopython`
	* `scikit-tda`
	* `py3dmol`
	* `PersistenceCurves`

* **Note:** This list of packages is contained in the `requirements.txt` file. The file was generated by calling `pip freeze > requirements.txt` from within an activated conda virtual environment on the host machine (namely, `conftopo`).

## Usage

	systemctl start docker
	```
1. Build the Docker image: 
	```
	docker build -f docker/conftopo-core/Dockerfile -t maduprey/conftopo-core .
	```
1. Push the image to DockerHub:
	```
	docker push maduprey/conftopo-core:latest
	```
